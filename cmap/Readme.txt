1) Get the rank of MYC (based on activity) compared to other trascription factors only for landmarks
2) Conduct pathway analysis and get paths (and their metrics) that were found enriched also in myc-knockdowns
3) The result of the analysis is found in pathway_results_myc.rds , which will be use for further analysis prioritizing compounds.
