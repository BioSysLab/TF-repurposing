1) Get the rank of MYC (based on activity) compared to other trascription factors only for landmarks
2) Conduct pathway analysis and get paths (and their metrics) that were found enriched also in myc-knockdowns
3) The results of the analysis demonstrate a little variance due to permutations conducted in the pathway enrichment algorithm/package
(fgsea) and so the analysis is conducted 5 times, having so results from 5 runs which will be aggregated in the next steps of the analysis.
