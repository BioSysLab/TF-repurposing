Here are the lists produced from the merging with genetic algorithms.

The final_act_down.rds is the final ranked list for the drugs tested in myc-active downregulated cell-lines.
The final_act_up.rds is the final ranked list for the drugs tested in myc-active upregulated cell-lines.
The final_inact.rds is the final ranked list for the drugs tested in myc-inactive cell-lines.

Warning: The list with the inactives the ranks are reversed. Meaning small rank means big IC50 value!!!!
